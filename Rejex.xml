            <line li="2">If I ain't know no better</line>
            <line li="3">I could have been sucked right up into the setup</line>
            <line li="4">But I kept my head up</line>
            <line li="5">And every time I fell I would get up</line>
            <line li="6">See I don't need no nines and Berettas</line>
            <line li="7">I kill with the lines and the letters with the verbs and the nouns</line>
            <line li="8">Just a kid trying get his sound heard around</line>
            <line li="9">Jump into cyphers and keep the old timers astounded</line>
            <line li="10">They said he was the best in the surroundance</line>
            <line li="11">Cause everyone around him was drownin'</line>
            <line li="12">In the fair one, no one son could pound him</line>
            <line li="13">With the lyrics, you pray you hear it</line>
            <line li="14">They say his bad hood couldn’t match his good spirit</line>
            <line li="15">And one day his mom and dad will be cheerin' to his grammy nomination</line>
            <line li="16">And proclamation to his world domination</line>
            <line li="17">Inauguration into greatness</line>
            <line li="18">From making rations to cakin'</line>
            <line li="19">2 AM and he be up like attic</line>
            <line li="20">He's an addict, alarm clock pop, he back at it</line>
            <line li="21">Barely got any sleep</line>
            <line li="22">But, he gotta eat</line>
            <line li="23">Cause ain't shit cheap and his soul/sole torned out of feet</line>
            <line li="24">He got dreams, but don't plan on sleeping until he reach 'em</line>
            <line li="25">Until you out feastin', paying houses where you sleep in</line>
            <line li="26">Until his album ready and his fans get it leaking just for sneak peaks and</line>
            <line li="27">Until then, his home is the booth</line>
            <line li="28">He spittin' to the plaque it's poof off his tooth</line>
            <line li="29">Like Hocus Pocus</line>
            <line li="30">Or word he's too focused</line>
            <line li="31">You should quote it</line>
            <line li="32">His goal is the denial that he wrote it</line>
            <line li="33">Flowin' like oceans and menstruals</line>
            <line li="34">Ink from the pen, lies within my credentials</line>
            <line li="35">They told me that I could be mental</line>
            <line li="36">But mommma always said that I was special</line>
            <line li="37">Haters tell me I should stop</line>
            <line li="38">My enemies tryin' see me in the box</line>
            <line li="39">So the streets tell me to cop a Glock and pop it</line>
            <line li="40">But something down deep tells me I'm the next prophet</line>
            <line li="41">Like the new Muhammad or the new Marcus Garvey</line>
            <line li="42">Or probably, it makes sense why I'm so heavily guarded</line>
            <line li="43">Wait, no, please restart it</line>
            <line li="44">I'm heavenly guarded, it's the golden child and for a while</line>
            <line li="45">God been looking down with a smile</line>
            <line li="46">Watchin' me prosper</line>
            <line li="47">Attackin' with the raps and then conquer</line>
            <line li="48">The junior Frank Sinatra, rapping out the Opera</line>
            <line li="49">You should spectate in the booth with a suit and binoculars</line>
            <line li="50">Like nigga its a honor, it's motherfuckin' honor</line></verse>
