               <br/> Late night cruisin' fusing the green with the cuban<br/> So swift we moving through clouds intruding<br/> Celestial Nubians, known them since<br/> I was a Brand Nubian and they influenced
                him<br/> And now it’s new beginnin’s, catch me sinnin’ in Sin
                City<br/> Sittin’ and spinnin’ and spittin’ in ya city<br/> Swimmin’ in ya bitty, put kin in her kitty and breasts<br/> Got protection in the vest, but still penetrate correct<br/> The vets, I got the remedy for these bitches<br/> Inject, enter sex and eject get some intellect<br/> And jet cuz all we do is flex on the weekends<br/>
                They upset cause I learned how to flex on the weakest<br/> End of my strength they drenched in they trenches<br/> The fence in my terrace is gold, leave ya defenseless in the cold<br/> And I know all you nigga’s weaknesses<br/> Through my threshold, sight on some instinctive shit<br/>
             This the song I wrote if I died;<br/>
             I was on the 50 mile doing 9-5<br/>
             Beating the pussy like it ain't got 9 lives<br/>
             And I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, ‘cause you only
                live once<br/>
             ‘Cause you only live once<br/>

             Ayo I don't really cry, ask why<br/>
             Cause inside, no one ever really dies<br/>
             Your presence is still alive<br/>
             Your voice I still hear it<br/>
             I still feel your spirit in a room feel heavenly with the scent of ya<br/>
             We wasn't on the issues but couldn't help but notice your views<br/>
             So many aspects of truth<br/>
             In fact you let the past get to you<br/>
             So thoughts on a better future, it couldn't suit you alone<br/>
             We was stoned, by the snakes of this life of sin<br/>
             But you taught me a life lesson, the fight within<br/>
             Use the power of our minds, I was confused at some hour in time<br/>
             My eyes were dark brown but blind<br/>
             But, now I see even the sun shines through blinds<br/>
             And now I move enlighten in sightings that I find<br/>
            
                Enticin' in my
                prime, like, look at me now<br/>
             You used to tell me read books, niggas bookin' me now<br/>
             But how, could I have done it without you though<br/>
             You was the big bro I never ever had you know?<br/>
             Why you had to go? It hurt me inside<br/>
             I feel guilty walking around outside with false pride<br/>
             If only we could vibe like, one more time<br/>
             Hear one more line or share one more rhyme<br/>
             Even show me one more sign of destiny itself would be fine<br/>
             But there's no turning back the, hands of time<br/>
             Or delayin'
                the plans of your mastermind<br/>
             So I hope you came across of what you had to find<br/>
             And watch over the ones you once loved<br/>
             You was my nigga when push came to shove<br/>
               <br/> Ayo I don't really cry, ask why<br/> Cause inside, no one ever really dies<br/> Your presence is still alive<br/> Your voice I still hear it<br/> I still feel your spirit in a room feel heavenly with the scent of ya<br/> We wasn't on the issues but couldn't help but notice your views<br/> So many aspects of truth<br/> In fact you let the past get to you<br/> So thoughts on a better future, it couldn't suit you alone<br/> We was stoned, by the snakes of this life of sin<br/> But you taught me a life lesson, the fight within<br/> Use the power of our minds, I was confused at some hour in time<br/> My eyes were dark brown but blind<br/> But, now I see even the sun shines through blinds<br/> And now I move enlighten in sightings that I find<br/>
                Enticin' in my
                prime, like, look at me now<br/> You used to tell me read books, niggas bookin' me now<br/> But how, could I have done it without you though<br/> You was the big bro I never ever had you know?<br/> Why you had to go? It hurt me inside<br/> I feel guilty walking around outside with false pride<br/> If only we could vibe like, one more time<br/> Hear one more line or share one more rhyme<br/> Even show me one more sign of destiny itself would be fine<br/> But there's no turning back the, hands of time<br/> Or delayin'
                the plans of your mastermind<br/> So I hope you came across of what you had to find<br/> And watch over the ones you once loved<br/> You was my nigga when push came to shove<br/>
             One love, one love, one love, one love<br/>
             The sky's the limit<br/>
             That's what they told the fuckin' fool<br/>
             I disguised the limit<br/>
             Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon x2<br/>
             Long Live Steelo<br/>
             Yo y-yo<br/>
             Y-yo yo yo 93 'til infinity, King Capital<br/>
             May your soul Rest in Peace<br/>
               <br/> One love, one love, one love, one love<br/> The sky's the limit<br/> That's what they told the fuckin' fool<br/> I disguised the limit<br/> Now I'm aiming for the sun and moon x2<br/> Long Live Steelo<br/> Yo y-yo<br/> Y-yo yo yo 93 'til infinity, King Capital<br/> May your soul Rest in Peace<br/>

             Lookin’ at popular colored faces<br/>
             Observing what my brothers faces in all races<br/>
             Lost in generations before hatred<br/>
             See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs<br/>
             But keep it sacred G, fuck a rat race, we take the
                    cheese<br/>
             Jack cheddar from the make believe<br/>
             Break the trees on they eighth CD<br/>
             Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully<br/>
             I’m a Brooklyn nigga, basically I grind with the
                grimiest<br/>

             I’ll be in a box with my coughin’ drops<br/>
             Why settle for a office spot?<br/>
            
                Niggas don’t always make it off the block<br/>
             Unless they extort rocks or support the cops<br/>
             They still snitchin’ - let me guess: that’s your mannequin?<br/>
