<h3>Poetic Devices</h3>
Joey Bada$$ employs a number of poetic devices throughout his lyrics, the six devices that this project is concerned with are as follows, alliteration, assimilation, 
assonance, consonance,rhyme, and slant rhyme. Prior to delving into the criteria for each of the six devices, it should be noted that the process of interpreting poetic devices
is not an exact science. Unfortunately, as with any other type of interpretation of data, there may be cases in which arguments could be made in favor of an alternative label for a given poetic
device. This possibility of differing interpretations can be largely attributed to the manner in which one hears a rappers "delivery" of their lyrics (voice inflection, stressing of particular syllables, etc.).
However, listening to a given rappers flow still allows one to interpret and categorize the type of poetic device used more accurately than simply reading the lyrics online. 

<h4>Alliteration:</h4> A poetic device in which there is a repetition of the first consonant in a series of multiple words. 
e.g. "pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas"

<h4>Assimilation:</h4> A poetic device in which one word becomes more phonologically similar to at least one other word, esentially the rappers delivery of the words produces a 
transformation in which the previously dissimilar words not seem to rhyme.
e.g. And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
     So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs, and the Allahs
     To keep us safe and watch our lives.

<h4>Assonance:</h4> A poetic device in which words near each other have a repetition of a vowel in nonrhyming stressed syllables.
e.g. Tend this racket while I'm cracking a Serena. 

<h4>Consonance:</h4> A poetic device in which words near each other have a repetition of a consonants in nonrhyming stressed syllables.
e.g. Show's too turnt out return home burnt out 

<h4>Rhyme:</h4> A poetic device in which there is a correspondence of sound between words or the endings of words.
e.g.I know she always think of little me, but now I got big literally
    Worldwide and physically
    I'm saying I used to take walks around Little Italy
    Now I roam 'round Sicily
    And I'm plotting on a milli

<h4>Slant Rhyme:</h4> A poetic device in which a rhyme is formed by words with similar but not identical sounds. 
Typically, either the vowels are different while the consonants are identical, or the consonants are different while the vowels are identical.
e.g. But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
     Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
