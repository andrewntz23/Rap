<stanza>[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
And that’s all people wanna see truthfully
Don't stop it Pat, just keep it runnin'</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
It's been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks
Clouds is they limits cause we in 'em, eyes low
Squinted, more L's but we winning, acting like it's
Hard to find women when I'm in these hard-to-find linens
Remember those days it was hard to find a living
But now we got ends, and it's only the beginning
Big pimpin', fooling dimes, rob 'em for they innocence
Cake like Entenmann's, flow sweet like cinnamon
He a child, but they treat him like a bigger man
Cause when the pen in his hand, they big 'em up like he Jigga man
Know you see him in the mirror fam, the ones who say
You ain't hot be your biggest fan like, "Nigga, damn."
Before he got popular, he been the man
With your chick in the cam, rolling through an Instagram
Got a whiff of grands, now everybody say they distant fam
Know the haters still jelly, but fuck it though; it's the jam
It's the fuckin' jam</stanza></track>
<track title="Waves"> 
<producer>Freddie Joachim</producer>
<stanza>[Intro]
Yeah
You remember back in the days when niggas used to rock waves and shit?
When like... Yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga
Like, nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
And that's real shit</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1]
Since 9-5, momma been working nine-five
And I know the landlord fed up with our lies
So we pray to the Gods, the Jahs, and the Allahs
To keep us safe and watch our lives
Cause all we tryna do is do good
Put on my hood when I walk through hoods
Cause these niggas these days is loco
You'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna go global
Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul
And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful will have me in the Daily Postal
Flying coastal eatin tofu
Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin
Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion
They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter
Right after I start laughin, they start askin “what happened?"
But back to the chapter
Momma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to
So that’s what I do, became an MC master
Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
Go ahead ask em "Who is Joey Bad?"
Watch em gasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad
He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due
Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you
It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals
Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found it your retinue
And they told me not to be so complex
Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex
And The Source, alfredo of course
There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course
I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse
With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk
For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north, speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost
Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse
Born boss no days off, child labor
Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes</stanza>

<stanza>[Interlude: 2Pac Speaking]
What the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person: You know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A. 
I'm coming at 'em a hundred percent real; I ain't compromising anything. 
Anybody that talk about me, got problems, you know what I'm sayin'? 
It's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person. 
That's how I'm comin' at the whole world, and I'm being real about it and I'mma grow with my music    </stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2]
But it's far from over
Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover
Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors
I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster
Known as history's biggest musical composer
No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner
Marijuana my odor, and when I get older
Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
Like 3 times, have 3 kids, I hope
Me and wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
I hope they acknowledge the knowledge cuz yeah, they 'gon need it
Cuz when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it
Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils
Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful
But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual
Even though over time, my punishments they grew more crucial
Should use the word brutal, cuz my parents mad strict
Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib
Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
Until then, all I can do is imagine

Imagine

I'mma make it all happen</stanza></track>

<stanza>[Intro]
(Go Brooklyn)
Said what it's like?
Joey Bad and Chuck Strangers
Leave niggas endangered
It's the real, yo what's the word word?
Pass the herbs
Check</stanza>
<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
My man Dirty had the buddha just to put me in my right mind
I rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines
Sight dimes wit' slight closed eyes, I'm slight soba
Ma you ain't that girl at giving throat so bye
F it I'm bi-po-la, took shorty to the backroom
Play charades, she actin like a vacuum
Showed her to the door before the afternoon
She fell hard on the floor, so you know that she'll be back soon
Fake MC's get their reps ruined
Young villain hop up on the track then the track doomed
Click-clack-boom, resurrecting Boom-Bap from the tombs
Raps dope like crack in cocoons
Back in this mood, back on the move
It's the motherfucking real, nigga chill act cool
Pay respect to the cat Drew
And I'm way too blessed to be throwing shots at you</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: Rokamouth]
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest
Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era</stanza>
<stanza>[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]
I'm tryna find my own lane, in this freeway of life
Just remember home boy there ain't no free way to life
My nigga it's gon cost you, try not to lose your soul
To the rims, hoes, and gold
Cause once the devil grab hold, that nigga ain't letting go
And I'm far from religious, I just know right and wrong
I know how to write these songs, I know how to light these bongs
I know how to rip thongs and I'm pretty good at beer pong
Nigga, I'm so crazy, nigga I'm loco
Gassed up like Sunoco, press the pedal through the floor
Bitch we out the door, Vroom vroom skuuurrt
Bitch love don't live here no more
Cause her weave look faker than her Louie bag
Weak chick I tried to bag, had the nerve to turn me down
Heard this song and turned around
Now she want me to unzip her pants
But I'm gone, bitch missed her chance
</stanza>
<stanza>[Hook] (x2)</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3 : Joey Bada$$]
I got sick of class, started making classics
Now all I really do is get the grass lit and bust asses
I'm sure to blow like bust acid
Puff, assist like Maravich, a true Maverick
And I average above average on an average day
Doing bad shit bet you still can’t pass this
And his teacher still pass him
Though they adolescents be addin' rappin' sessions over addin' lessons
Like fuck trigonometry, I’m trying to multiply monopolies
Subtract some homies then divide the cheese
Divide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the E
Shit on you hypotheses
Hypocrisy after essence like apostrophes
You can’t stand here unless you pay a posture fee
Part the cheese, head out the spot and leave
A pile of G's for apology</stanza></track>

<track title="Survival_Tactics">    
<producer>Vin Skully</producer>

<stanza>[Intro]
It's either, them or you
It's sort of like, survival you know. Survival of the fittest you know
You do what you do to stay alive</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey]
Niggas don't want war I'm a martian with an army of spartans
Sparring with a knife in a missile fight
Get your intel right, your intelligence is irrelevant
But it's definite I spit more than speech impediments
Brooklyn's the residence, the best and it's evident
We got them niggas P-E-Nuts, like they elephants
Throw 'em in a trunk if they hate though
We don't give a fuck as long as we collect our pay, so
Ya'll collect pesos, ya money ain't right here
I got them girls next to the wood like they light year, I'm right chea
Tryna get a buzz, tryna pollinate
STEEZ got that presidential shit out to inaugurate
My P.E conglomerates bout to P-E-E on any wanna B-E, weak MC
Air 'em out or leave 'em empty congratulate the semi-auto
Fire flame spitter like komodo
No time for fake people, they be simmin' like Kimora
I'm the empor-ah in search of the adora, my heart go
Ba boom Ba boom Ba boom boom
It's panic like Dora when shots blast
See I was raised that way, I'm from the place where they raise that K
Like every day in every way and every where you go, just ain't safe
The only thing that I can say, to you is pray
Cause when niggas start equippin', and throw the clip in
Your blood drippin', and got you slippin'
Another victim, don't know whats hit them – through his spinal
Just another man who defeated by survival
That's your biggest rival, in your whole life
These bars you can't handle you better hold tight
They sayin' I'm the best, I'm like you're so right
Still ain't got enough shine to last the whole night, nigga</stanza>

<stanza>[Interlude]
Yo, fuck the police nigga
Fuck every ass corrupt politician on Wall Street
P.E, Public Enemy, Assassinate us, bitch
Fuck that, fuck everything son
Fuck government, Fuck, listenin' and shit

You want fuckin' energy? Dickheads</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
It's like 6 milli ways to die my nigga choose one
Doomsday comin' start investin' in a few guns
New gats, booby traps, and bazooka straps
Better play your cards right, no booster packs
Everybody claim they used to rap
But these ain't even punchlines no more, I'm abusing tracks
Leaving instrumentals blue and black
I'm in Marty McFly mode, so tell em' that the future's back
Riding on hoverboards, wiping out motherboards
Stopped spitting fire cause my motherfuckin lung is scorched
King Arthur when he swung his sword
A king author I ain't even use a pen in like a month or four
I had a hard time writing lyrics
Now I'm way over heads, science fiction
You can try and get it, my man the flyest with it
With a mind of fine of interest for your finest interests
They say hard work pays off
Well tell the Based God don't quit his day job
Cause P.E's about to take off
With protons and electrons homie that's an A-bomb
Fuckin' ridiculous
Finger to the president screamin' "fuck censorship!"
If Obama got that president election
Then them P.E. boys bout to make an intervention
Fuck what I once said, I want the blood shed
Cause now-a-days for respect you gotta pump lead
I guess Columbine was listenin' to Chaka Khan
And Pokémon wasn't gettin' recognized at Comic-Con
It's like we've been content with losin'
And half our students fallen victim to the institution
Jobs are scarce since the Scientific Revolution
And little kids are shootin' Uzi's cause its given to 'em
Little weapon, code name: Smith and Wesson
And you'll be quick to catch a bullet like an interception
If your man’s tryna disrespect it
Send a message and it's over in a millisecond - nigga</stanza></track>

Yes, Strawberries</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I'm a beast with these flows
Two birds, one stoned, you get geese’d when trees rolled
They say I'm evil cause I trained my ego to see gold
Cause he know, seagulls couldn't see these goals, please
It's the return of the beast coast
No cash flashed, but the cheese still make teeth show
Incognito, is how you move on the strip
What you trynna be Vito? Well there's rules to this shit
Don't get clapped, ya'll ain't real spitters, ya'll lips chapped
Better watch it, Mr. Nicewatch, don't risk that
I got a 6 pack of bare skill that I spill like that
And everybody know (That shit crack!)
Ya'll niggas softspoken, down below choking
The type to drop the soap when you soakin' in front of most men
There's makes sense why you want beef, well this frozen
It's nuts for you screwed in the tool, and can't hold em
Better shoot yourself Plaxico, because I'm next to go
The Progressive flows from New York to New Mexico
My lyrical span is what the fans is demandin'
Step into my box and that's exactly what'chu stand in
Ain't no half steppin' around me
And you gotta drown a fish before you clown me
The young cop killer, I'm dat ill, so doc' will ya
Give me two shots for 2Pac killer....nigga</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2:Capital STEEZ]
Soul searchin' 'till my flows are perfect
I ain't trynna be a slave to grow old from workin'
Sorry BADA$$, you lucky that I peeped it second
Tell them niggas keep it steppin' with they beat selection
Check the melodies, it's so heavenly
That shit'll get your hipster move with no 7D's
Audi-opium, can I bust soliloquies
Got that shit mix and mastered both remedies
Grab a spoonful, we sturrin' up a pot
And you know we gotta serve it while it's hot
I'm flowin' like a volcano and drippin' verses off the top
Dirty cops still swervin' on the block
Lookin' for black kids, that spittin' up acid
It's in my jeans so don't worry what my pants is
Get with the script it's that ignorant shit
And they bound to get sick of us quick but I ain't sealin' my lips
It's a shift, I know you feel it man
We blowin' up like a ceiling fan
Droppin' off jewels like Killa Cam's man
When it comes to kickin' verses I'm Mr. Van Damme
Crushin' strawberries it's a jam
So throw up both hands if you can
Ironic how I'm killin' this shit, until they bury me
My volume is going in depth with longevity
Stupids</stanza></track>

<stanza>[Intro: Joey BadA$$]
Check it, word word
What's the word word
Yeah, check!</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey BadA$$]
Just got word from my mans on the island, he said he needed guidance
Niggas on the streets is wilin', he look to God but can't find him
So he demand silence from the glaring sirens
The sympathy symphony, only thing playing is the banned violence
No lying niggas just won't let go the iron
They wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
Treat beef like they let go lions
So don't eye 'em they get the wrong message, wrong methods
Put you on that long stretcher
Too much pressure, God bless ya when the semi wet'cha
They told me "more dress-up" I'm giving too many lectures
And I'm putting in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
Like "they gon' catch up" fuck what you must heard!
But I done puffed enough herb
To be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
I got enough shit on my mind
So I don't need to be stressing and shine, it's fine</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: Joey BadA$$]
One day I'm tryna have a wife and kids
So I just can't live my life like this
And I ain't tryna learn what lifeless is
So I just can't live my life like this
I want the gold chains and diamond rings
But I just can't live my life like this
And sometimes I just wanna light this spliff
But I just can't live my life like this</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Got a collect call from up top
My cousin called me and what not
The motto never changed it’s still fuck cops
We went from having lunch in our lunchbox
Our lungs was hot whenever we'd puff pot
We'd touch blocks and end up having to duck shots
But fuck dot, ain’t trying live that life no more
My mind corrupted but my heart is still pure
Gotta be brave can’t be afraid
Braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
Trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
Fuck a priest’s opinion, knock the hinges off of Heaven’s gates
Trying to share my cells with my mate, not share a cell with mates
Wrecking shit with my recklessness
The L get lit that’s when I start second guessing shit
Thinking ‘bout Ty and then I reminisce
What you thought you niggas could’ve fuck me over
Never nigga guess again
I’m street so cross me like pedestrians
And that’s gon' be the end of it, straight revoking your membership</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: CJ Fly]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3: Joey BadA$$]
Niggas wanna know what I’m about, I’m bout blowing loud
On the block sporty, Glock 40 in a politician mouth
I take the competition out commission with my composition
Who the kid spitting behind the bars like a con position
Gotta give ‘em time to listen, they’ll soon bump to it
They’ll like me, I kick it like Nike they’ll soon adjust to it
But if you hate I know you must do it
I ain’t mad at you I keep my attitude on "screw it a million bucks should do it"
I’m out for presidents to represent me
Yo chick keep messaging me, who the bestest MC? They be mentioning me
Too hot, I be molesting the beat, fuck math
Teachers should teach us to get Smith and Wesson’s off of the street
So first class be a lesson for me
Fuck what you teaching for some regents, I'm flying over regions
Reaching, all time highs where Jesus can’t reach us
Step to me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
This is for my niggas, killers, hundred dollar billers
On the block in the rock spot, Glock cocked watching out for cops
All about their cheddar, young guns know nothing that’s better
Like fuck a prison letter, those Beretta’s led us to the lettuce
Relish fetishes, menaces want the senator’s percentages
If you ain't prejudice you still a nemesis
Smoking on the Clematis, get open like a present is
Now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
My city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
They linking terrorists from the Stuy to Lincoln Terraces
Stay on that reckless shit, they leave you left for the dead
Kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
Children on the corners slinging some regs, popping some meds
Jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
I be back stage gripping haze breaking my leg
My folks was making the best when they was naked in bed, muthafucka</stanza>

The same thing we do every night Pinky
Try to take over the world

(Joey) Who the fuck is this Joey Bada$$ nigga son?</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]
Aye yo who the fuck passed you the mic
And said that you could flow?
Point 'em out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic?

Check!    </stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1]
Puffin' on stramonium
Underground like potholes but going fossil
These bars like art in the Smithsonian
These flows is for custodians, homeless men, horny OBGYN dudes
Browsing my laptop lookin' at red fallopian tube
They like "Yo Joey you rude"
I'm like "If only you knew I'm only in school for cosmology
That's why I act as lonely as you"
You see I'm wise behind my years and my peers
So my voice over the snares is the only way they hear
What I got behind my membrane, but I've been smoking chem strains
So lately I've been having hard times with remembering
But be patient, my studies prove Egyptians ancient
Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in the Matrix
But fuck it, I'm erratic, momma lock me in the attic please
Til I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy
And come out imputed with fusions of Blueprints and Illmatics
I’ve been going raw, this just how I feel rappin'
We gave y'all sur' tactics, so y'all can’t even gas us
We taught you how to be prepared but still attacking the masses
Y'all better get y'all caskets cause we ‘bout to annihilate
(The New Babylon Era) My empire gate’s in the Empire State
I’m on the higer platform, look at the way they clap for ‘em
Never fuck with phony men cause I don’t like my back torn
Nigga ask kwon - this that top ramen' you ain’t used to
Keep it neutral to scruple and tell ‘em no beef like noodles!!

Keep it neutral, just so you can scruple
</stanza>

<stanza>[Bridge]
I tell ‘em no beef like noodles
It’s world domination, (nation) you’re tuned into my station
Always got a doobie and a motherfucking eighth lit
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain’t about to rise to the top with my fucking team

<stanza>[Verse 1]
Another love song gone wrong
Should've known you were a woo, like Based God in Wonton
But I didn't, and I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball but I'm still glad I hit it
Cause a lot of niggas didn't you know - the coulda shoulda type
Like "Oh, it was slight too tight, come on, I would've piped
But our schedules contradicted we're always tied down"
Ay pipe down, the first night ya boy layed the pipe down
Took off the night gown and, pulled out the slinky
She screamed "Joey spank me!"
And after that she even thanked me, swanky!
One time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we be kicking rhymes 'til the end of time
But, back to the topic, oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off and wondering why my shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga do miss her lip gloss
Now she sucks the next nigga dick off and my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm 'posed to do
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent them postcards so you know it's true
I promise that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you front like you don't miss my whole cockpit down yo esophagus
Screaming daddy stop it, ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polishing in the scratches on my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled
And I tried to suck your titty-hole for milk for my cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came
I hit that spot twice and since then you haven't been the same
But now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name but my first impression, "What a lame"
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
Faggot, 6 months, and I'm still at it
You'll probably never hear this track but I still wrapped it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you would not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and it’s kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears</stanza>

<stanza>[Bridge]
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry

Aight fuck that, word word
Lord Finnesse, Jayo its been my jail since a day old but they know
Yea this ones for the ladies
Who be tryna have my baby</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1]
Ayo word to my mother
Two things I never do is leave the crib without some rubbers
Or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like whoa don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote overnight
Ask Kwon he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it if you fear hate it you get put into this clear space</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook x8]
I dont trust these bitches they would never catch me slippin'</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2]
Hey yo, I’m attached too, to the cash rules, 'bout to go nuts
Niggas get their attitudes to these cash you
Who you know that cool that they drip swagoo
And I’m here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga that’s the second time I passed you
Eating my gas fume, got me thinking like who gassed you
Your girl got gas too
She let me tackle for a Dutch and a Snapple
And that's who you decide to put on shackles
I’m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume
All up in the cut, no alcohol just mad booze
Tryin to find a pad to bring her back to
Like a tadpole, I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for
Losing to they back bones, looking at my cock tip
Down to do all all no matter what the synopsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
They all unconscious topless exposing they crotch and shit</stanza>

<track title="Daily_Routine">
<producer>Chuck Strangers</producer>
<stanza>[Verse 1]
From the block to the top, Buddha baggies in the sock
Only thing that changed now is we ain't runnin' out of stock
Used to beg mom dukes for lunch money
Honeys used to run from me when pockets was dust bunnies
Now what's funny is we done came up and conquered
Even the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers
Though them gangstas grill, I tell 'em keep that drama away
Don't fuck with thieves, I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape
They launchin' out strays, I'm tryin' not to get sprayed
Whether a spitter or a quitter behind the trigger, approaching his prey
His eyes bigger, won't stop to consider
What's right or wrong, because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]
But that's just daily routine
The streets are cooped fiends
Whether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams
Better choose the right scheme
Cause you could think you're cool with your nice things
But get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2]
Traded in my Nikes for a new mic
I guess it's safe to say he sold soul for his new life
Like they were tryna blind us, but we know the true designer
They didn't wanna see us find the diviners
So now we hit the vines up day and night
On the regular, I know my momma prayin' like
She want me reach my aims in life, but just stay in sight
So I'm shootin' for my dreams, hit the booth and it boost my esteem
The Pro Era crew recruitin' in them fiends by the boat load
Nigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal
They don't feel the name but they say the music dope though
Fuck it, that's how it's supposed to go, these bloggers too emotional
They'll be postin' you until labels start inter-scopin' you
By then, it's wild late and I'll be chillin' where I lay
Cause I'd rather see the top than to be livin' where I lay
Imbalances in my Kundalini, they tryna put two through my beanie
Wish you well, tryin' to poof a genie</stanza>

Owww (owwwwwww)
Uh uh (uh uh) x3
It's like (it's like)</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in the stadium playing or on the radio sayin'
"Fuck 'em broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em!"
But always find my self back at the bacchanalian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop but I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been slacking the skill, although my passion is real
I'm too caught up catching a feel when I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger that affected my hunger
Got older in number, realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin', these motherfuckas racist
These ain't fair races, they just let the fear erase us
Adopted by the slums, son of guns this is how they raised us
Yo son we gotta raise up, don't let them just array us
'Til we raisins in the sun
So we gotta wake up</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: T'nah Apex]
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent, Apex on the vertex, tonight we're serving serpents

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]
Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I
Sold my soul and ain't received a receipt but I won't proceed to retreat
Jigga told me watch your throne seat
And now I sees it and in respect to BIG, I gotta Cease it
And I hope he see me cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green, they just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth
I found a new balance
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance just like a relative
Marijuana sedatives got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the senate is
Cause they corruptin' the youth, we ain't inductin' the truth
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: T'nah Apex]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]
I passed the dutch to the left and it started to make sense
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent
You've been warned on the risk it takes to take to sit on top
Been on clock cause you could see that I been on watch
Shit don't stop, 'til you make the sacrifices
Trade in whats priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where Christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I valor the booth
The blacker the berry is the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards to the power of truth
Became flowers from roots and now we just move in cahoots
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for</stanza>

Yo, what's the word word
Pass the herbs
Pass the herbs, pass the herbs
Had to learn, had to learn (had To learn)
We just had to burn</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
It all started with this special herb
Then after that it came to sexual words
I'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse
She played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside the walls
I cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all
Mine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times
Not because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her
On the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her
She played the hustler and I'm like mad customers
Man swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it
Be blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted, but
It's all cool cause when in love we all fools
They say men lie and women lay naked that's all foolin'
Numbers don't matter after the first night
Right, so what the fuck is love at the first sight
If you ask me, another stupid analogy
Made to cover flaws in the female anatomy</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]
But I'm a keep gradually telling these bitches
Don't front, (don't front), don't front, (don't front)
Don't front, (don- don't front), don't front though
I got some weed and some fronto
(Don't front)
And you know I always hunt hoes
I tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door
Now don't front, (don't front), don't front, (don't front)
Check, (don- don- don't front)</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
It's like a massacre when mass occur
I got a massive urge but I had to learn
Heard you had it on lock so I pass the word
I stash the herb, sit back observe
That she make me feel good is all I ask of her
In the clouds who would've known, We would've crash and burn
I prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her
I ain't mad at her
But I really wish that it ain't have to hurt
Let's be blunt we're best buds
Both knew our role this is more than just a crush
I used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch
But now I rarely even see her
In everybody hood not even the law enforcement can keep up
She ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low
Any time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe
I thought I knew her better than anyone would know
Bagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her
Didn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper
Whenever I was with her, my mind would just relax
Could've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and
I admit it girl you fine as hell
Don't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells
You tryna find her then follow her trail
She left a few old lovers inside of a jail
That's all a part of the tale</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Hey yo don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription
Emotionless positions and provocative visions
Should've known you missed a note like the octave was switching
Remember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches
It's a simulation yeah, stimulation
Take off your shirt, let me feel manipulative
My heart like the Himalayas but yeah I got a slay her
I'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player
Sort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you
And I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you
So this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual
Nothing you ain't used to so my nothing is useable</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
We all try when you go bye, we all high
Truth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies
So label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care
I just learned to use my heart less, gain sanity and lost stress
It put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me
Kept the secrets you told me, emotions I would hold beneath
Always kept the L so I know defeat
Said everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave
Not sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre
I was still body with a glove on, you know I'm a cold ma
I'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark
When it flooded, used to always feel like Noah</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]
And I know I know her
Had these kind of skills I had to show her
So I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters
Came back through and I put it in the holster
Just had to teach her one time
Put it down, don't really give a fuck though
Don't front
And tell your bitch don't front though
Don't front</stanza></track>

<stanza>[Verse 1]
I never knew the world could be this mad
Only vision I had of sex was Color Me Badd
And I never knew the world could be this cold
Only time a nigga die, he was playing a role
But now niggas get their souls stole' so often
They only thing they offer dreamers is a wake and a coffin
From NY, to Compton, down to Austin
She said that orifice morph into abortions without precaution
Problem with our people, there's too many wanna-be Jordan
Too many forces thinking they could make a fortune scorin'
Too many wanna-be actors instead of achieving their masters
At least a bachelors but no, too many wanna-be rappers
That's just statistics, don't mistake me for hypocrites
Like niggas in the White House supplying Wite-Out
On Jim Crow Laws, you probably missed it
Hard to be persistent when you're tryin' to fight for your existence</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook x2]
It ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis
It really ain't easy livin' life like this
When you tryin' to be righteous but know a nigga might just
Leave you lifeless for prices, or high tech devices
So keep that TEC-9 or meet your crisis</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2]
Person mad nervous, you surrender to sterling
Look them in the eye, If looks made you die, you know you merk ‘em
Right there, plus his hide is like, right here
So you know that if you would fight fair then you'd have him like, quite scared
But don't forget the TEC held high by your right ear
So listen loud and clear: you don't wanna lose your life, dear
And don’t you show a slight tear or let 'em sight fear
Just let 'em disappear the night air, yea with your Nike Airs
Ride by the crackheads, left alone in the apartment
Mothers be jobless, so they make dollars shaking it topless, and
Daddy been gone said he, took off like ostrich
Since he gain knowledge, I’m keeping it with the synopsis, and
Shit like that make you wish you were adopted
To escape the pain, you join a gang and get intoxicated
Have no shame, nothing wrong with some Mary Jane
The only thing is you do it again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again...</stanza>

<stanza>[Interlude: Belly scene]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3]
Imagine me fed up, a go-getter, for mo' cheddar
Po' never, blow Berettas ‘cause I know no better
No Era, no STEEZ, no Kirk, no Lee
No school, no OG, no talent, no me
What if I just ain't act right?
What if I pack crack white with my sack tight, join the gat fight?
The click-clack type, slide in the vipe with the black stripe
And give my friends the back knife, ‘cause "That's life, nigga"</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
Let's get down tonight
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house
Let a nigga run his mouth
It's going down on sight
I'm always down to fight
Ain't duff a nigga in the while, no bluff
Ain't no chuch when you're living in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd
Rippin' on some loud
'Till I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow must've been the material linen
Whole night kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops I know niggas known for serial killin'
But back to the women
They tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venoms
From entering my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sis then
I put'em in the system</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: Joey BADA$$]
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)
Let me know x4</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]
Yo let me tell you what I'm living like
Same shit just a different night
Super bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite
'Bout to get down
I'm tryna get up in the tight
So roll the endo right
And I can show you what them bitches like
They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come
But don't touch my funds
I might get crazy
I might bust a gun
So just give me some more
And I might bust her son
Might bust and run
They said love will come knockin' at my door
Well I guess lust must've wrung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on
Had her beggin' for the dawn 'till the crack of dawn
Then I passed it off to Kwon
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank
Cause some pull hoes like ?
Hold up
Let me pull ove'
Told her to hop in then put it back and drove
And hit it out-park like Al Pujols</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook: Joey BADA$$ and Kirk Knight]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]
She's so enticing
Derogatory thoughts when I'm sighting
Slangs to get her wet
And i heard you're overflowing, I could test the waters like sea man, and i heard you like semen, see man
Well let me slide through I know you're feelin' the kid
Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in
Cause on contrast
I could see us lovebirds it's in plain sight
And am I right cause I heard you like the international lovin'
On a higher scale
When I mean scale I do it well
Let me go deeper feel like I'm doing it well
Word on the street you acting like a bastard
Can I be you daddy?
You can hop up in my caddy
And I heard you got the fatty
Yeah cellurite
Just remember it's amazing how I come up on the track
So duck and weave
And please believe
My side effect is shakin' knees
Damn here I go again with the suggestive themes</stanza>

Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
Said I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit
Suspect niggas don't come outside
You might get your wig pushed back tonight
I deserve my respect
Brains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
Started blazing and star gazing
See how you can reach your farthest aspirations
It's like holy matrimony in The Matrix
It ain't shit, they just call it a strange shift
Cold feet cause I'm on thin ice
It's alright besides the fact I want it all in one night
Like, you can't skip steps is the best
Even though the vets hold a .47 with a vest
Now that's a wise investment
Or a concept to try and hide divine intentions
It's like, let em hate, stay calm and meditate
When life has the lemons it's time to eliminate
More sour than lemonade, anyways
Different days, different highs, different haze
Kama Sutra with miss Mary Jane
And the karma suits her, she a vibrant thang</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
You niggas is suspect and I'm just a ruffneck
That wasn't breaking pencil tips when I would bust lead
I puff meds and leave chumps fed and punks dead
Her cunt wet she getting rough sex no sunset
I like a chick with a buck tooth yeah it could get fucked too
We keep one eye open they sus too
Never tell em my government make any covenant bitches be loving it
Say not to put a glove on it some funny shit
You must've thought I was a dummy Miss
I feed lines to felines just to get up in their tummies quick
Yeah you got tricks but I got five more
So any game you try to play you better know I got the high score
You better settle down cause you not on my level now
The Pros is semi-circle they can tell the world you get around
Some niggas clowns what's the shit about
They used to doubt now they see us sprout and I'm out</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 3: Chuck Strangers]
When I was thirteen I was bad, rapping about guns we never had
Now we smoke raws with filter tips, old homies talking shit
Said you was best of mine but you stay plotting on that dime
Thought cause we was cool before that we gon' take yo ass on tour fuck nah
This my chance to get it
How you entitled to my shine, nigga you ain't help me get it
Now these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit
My profile get requested but I never hit accept
Hit the sour to the chest, I reflect
When I was fourteen, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen
Eyes beam, cause we can make it better
Smoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 4: Dyemond Lewis]
And brains don't matter
But tell me what really matters when you pissed off at the world
Like you got a crazy bladder and
Momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters
So I gather my thoughts
And make use of all these synonyms
Cause I could never swallow the truth
Like it's cinnamon
Excuse me if I'm militant the sinning men in my hood
Could leave a nigga quivering like goddamn
Deliver him the venom and his liver is corrupting all his ligaments
Now he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again
The fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering
Now take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline
Penicillin could not stop the drive he be giving em like
Mad fours (Fords) and fast forward let's get to the part where his records
Could 'ford him a couple Fords like Lord
Ain't he gifted, Christmas just doesn't fit him
I need my own holiday and by the way
I'mma possibly own Monopoly and all McDonald's property
Cause I won't live in poverty like</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 5: NYCk Caution]
In the clouds come and find me son, I'm flier than Hermione
Homie tripping got em sounding like Hansen in the nineties
Charlie Manson your whole body cause that damage in your party
Can you manage what I'm dishing out, go get your wishing count
You sell me something then I flip that amount
I just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out yeah
They all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt
Rip your lips off your mouth
Man I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting
Cars with no license
Hard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident damn
Picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it
I'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana purchase
So declare that, with my hair back
You want a fair one, catch a fair smack
I hunt up on my prey
So pray I ain't hunting on your ass today, like be afraid</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
Cool cuts flow, the deli can't touch this
Slipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher
And I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow
Anything just let the leaves know, oh
Sucka's fuck around, get clapped where you rest at
Nigga saying you cracking, fire break you imagination ask your lady
It's assassin when I come up on the track
It's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses
But I got your attention, it's part of my ascension
But if I keep toking this strain is gonna leave me stranded
In this dimension, or to mention
Niggas is snitching, might charge me with battery
But fuck that cause piss was never in your anatomy
So don't try to lie on a nigga that got mine on my third eye shit</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 7: Rokamouth]
Man I'm on my higher degrees without my masters
I could use my words to urge into disasters
Niggas wanna know how my wheels keep on spinning
And they see we getting love cause they see the pros is winning
Cause we giving love back so they peeping how we fitting
Ain't gonna have no sus nigga stepping to me
I like to keep my chakras open so respect my G
I got the bush going in, repping FPT
So sus niggas watch your back pros next to me
I got Chuck on the team to collect the green
And show these suspect niggas what it mean to scheme
Another Apex predator crushing your dreams
Gonna get your wig pushed back between my cream
Taking all you sus niggas throw you out the scene
I'm taking all you sus niggas throw you out the scene
Taking all you sus niggas throw you out the scene</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 8: T'nah Apex]
The P the R the O the Dette
Never am I vexed, I'm always calm, cool, collect
Unless you disrespect, I wreck you verbally
So expect the worst from me, I beck you with my intellect
You best be circumspect check, made you making all the wrong moves
Do I intimidate you or more infuriate you
Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gold
Lovers I decapitate with everything I say, see
Come sneak a peak and, tell me what you peeping
Then struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seeing
It is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious
No you're not delirious, I'm serious it's clear to us
Add some crystals gonna see gold then platinum
Seen it on some tarots before, so I know how it is all gonna go down
Gotta go more uptown, more in the cloud
Cause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound
And my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town
So assume what you please but you don't know me
Say what you please but you don't know T'nah</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 9: Dessy Hinds]
Who that mofo who came to show boat just cause he float like no other
Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers
So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest
Is making real tracks with feelings, people ain't feel yet
Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records
Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds
So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant
I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds
Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line
The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up
Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood
So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary
From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time
Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line
So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine
Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine</stanza>

<stanza>[Hook]</stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 10: Joey Bada$$]
'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is (s)ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know
I found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal
This one for my people, headed to the top, no redo
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be knievel
I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me clever
See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error
The Era</stanza>
