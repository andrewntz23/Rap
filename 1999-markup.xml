<li>It is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious</li>
<li>No you're not delirious, I'm serious it's clear to us</li>
<li>Add some crystals gonna see gold then platinum</li>
<li>Seen it on some tarots before, so I know how it is all gonna go down</li>
<li>Gotta go more uptown, more in the cloud</li>
<li>Cause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound</li>
<li>And my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town</li>
<li>So assume what you please but you don't know me</li>
<li>Say what you please but you don't know T'nah</li></stanza>

<li>Who that mofo who came to show boat just cause he float like no other</li>
<li>Style smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers</li>
<li>So going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest</li>
<li>Is making real tracks with feelings, people ain't feel yet</li>
<li>Dessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records</li>
<li>Set in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds</li>
<li>So you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant</li>
<li>I eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds</li>
<li>Remember I'm the face so lace me in the line</li>
<li>The bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up</li>
<li>Define what never can judge, rap is in my blood</li>
<li>So much, my capularies adapted a sanctuary</li>
<li>From the 5th of January, every punchline turned into crunch time</li>
<li>Was cutting records more times than my school's lunch line</li>
<li>So if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine</li>
<li>Been spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine</li></stanza>

<li>'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry</li>
<li>Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes</li>
<li>Won't cower, won't move cause I don't move like a coward</li>
<li>Knowledge is power and the flower of life is (s)ours</li>
<li>Get as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers</li>
<li>Scour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power</li>
<li>We all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know</li>
<li>I found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows but fuck that</li>
<li>This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval</li>
<li>I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal</li>
<li>This one for my people, headed to the top, no redo</li>
<li>Thinking up evil but see no evil just be knievel</li>
<li>I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better</li>
<li>They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar</li>
<li>And the green only made me clever</li>
<li>See God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error</li>
