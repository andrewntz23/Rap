<li>Yeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul</li>
<li>And I’m hopeful that me spittin it soulful will have me in the Daily Postal</li>
<li>Flying coastal eatin tofu</li>
<li>Like I told you I know niggas who trash rappin</li>
<li>Worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin' passion</li>
<li>They want me send em tracks but I just send em laughter</li>
<li>Right after I start laughin, they start askin “what happened?"</li>
<li>But back to the chapter</li>
<li>Momma told me follow dreams, should never have to ask her, to</li>
<li>So that’s what I do, became an MC master</li>
<li>Since then it’s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper</li>
<li>Go ahead ask em "Who is Joey Bad?"</li>
<li>Watch em gasp, asthma, damn it’s so sad</li>
<li>He paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up</li>
<li>Than to admit the kid is hotter than magma</li>
<li>But fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due</li>
<li>Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you</li>
<li>It can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals</li>
<li>Or get you 2 to 3 for residue found it your retinue</li>
<li>And they told me not to be so complex</li>
<li>Dumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex</li>
<li>And The Source, alfredo of course</li>
<li>There I go again, steppin out of line, runnin' off course</li>
<li>I heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse</li>
<li>With your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk</li>
<li>For it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north, speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults</li>
<li>I'm sure by now you can assume he never lost</li>
<li>Unless with some form of divorce, or a corpse</li>
<li>Born boss no days off, child labor</li>
<li>Let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes</li></stanza>

<stanza type="interlude" speaker="2pac">
<li>What the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person: You know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A. </li>
<li>I'm coming at 'em a hundred percent real; I ain't compromising anything. </li>
<li>Anybody that talk about me, got problems, you know what I'm sayin'? </li>
<li>It's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person. </li>
<li>That's how I'm comin' at the whole world, and I'm being real about it and I'mma grow with my music    </li></stanza>

<stanza>[Verse 2]
<li>But it's far from over</li>
<li>Won't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover</li>
<li>Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors</li>
<li>I blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster</li>
<li>Known as history's biggest musical composer</li>
<li>No disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner</li>
<li>Marijuana my odor, and when I get older</li>
<li>Hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum</li>
<li>Like 3 times, have 3 kids, I hope</li>
<li>Me and wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did</li>
<li>I hope they acknowledge the knowledge cuz yeah, they 'gon need it</li>
<li>Cuz when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it</li>
<li>Couldn't believe it, 'til I saw with my own pupils</li>
<li>Felt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful</li>
<li>But fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual</li>
<li>Even though over time, my punishments they grew more crucial</li>
<li>Should use the word brutal, cuz my parents mad strict</li>
<li>Hope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib</li>
<li>Go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered</li>
<li>Until then, all I can do is imagine</li>

<li>Imagine</li>

<li>I'mma make it all happen</li></stanza></track>
