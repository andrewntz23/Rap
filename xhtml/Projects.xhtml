                        <p>Joey's second solo mixtape. Released on September 6, 2012, in Joey's words, Rejex is "a compilation of tracks that didn't make it to my debut mixtape "1999" (obviously).
                            I decided to put this project together because I have a lot of unreleased material that I didn't want to keep from the ears of my fans and 
                            supporters. I also have a couple of tracks on here I did when I was 15 years old ("little rachel", "indubitable", and "silent knight") and 
                            I want to show people the progress I've made in a couple of years. The remaining songs ("flowers pt. I", "catharsis", "panty raid", "fantum" 
                            and "update") are tracks I dropped prior to the release of '99 as promo only. I look at "rejex" as my more experimental side compared to '99. 
                            Putting together these two projects even taught me a lil sumchin about my evolution as an artist and individual. Watch me go from "Joey B4 DA $$" 
                            to the "Joey BA DA $$"...... If you know what eye mean.. Haha -oG $wank" Production includes the likes of Chuck Strangers, Madlib, MF Doom, 9th Wonder, Cyne, and 
                        Lord Finesse.</p>
