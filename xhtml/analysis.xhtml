                        <p>Motif Graph (Overall) Writeup The bar representing the ‘women’ tag is
                            quite high due to the fact that each instance of “she” and “her” is
                            tagged throughout the corpus, inflating the results (as compared to
                            where they would be if each instance of a woman being referenced was
                            marked rather than every word indicating a woman); additionally, certain
                            songs (“That Gushy,” for instance) contain a count of ‘women’ references
                            that is above average. Violence is a common theme due to the rough area
                            of Brooklyn in which Joey grew up and which played a heavy influence on
                            his hip-hop style. Success, whether pursuit or possession, is a common
                            theme in Joey’s music due to the lofty aspirations that he has for
                            himself and his crew, the Pros. The hiphop and money tags are expectedly
                            higher than average due to the fact that they are important themes in
                            Joey’s life; Joey has said that hip-hop raised him, and money is an
                            obvious focus for him (as can be seen in the title of his first album,
                            B4.DA.$$. —read as “Before da Money”). Religion was a strong part of
                            Joey’s upbringing, and currently holds profound beliefs involving
                            third-eye mysticism, and this is reflected in the number of occurrences
                            of the ‘religion’ tag. Sex is a somewhat obvious topic of discussion for
                            a young, newly successful rap star.. </p>
                        <p>We utilized Cytoscape, a tool that is used for generating Social Network
                            Graphs, in order to graphically display our data in an engaging and
                            interesting way. We generated three social network graphs, each of which
                            use the albums as nodes and their relationship with other nodes as
                            edges. Using xslt we gathered the data on (respectively) artists,
                            producers, and hip hop references, and developed the following three
                            graphs tracking the frequency of appearance of these elements.</p>
                        <h3>Artists who Rapped Together on the Same Song in the Corpus</h3>
                        <iframe class="img" src="../svg/FinalRappedTogether.svg"></iframe>
                        <p>This social network graph reveals the artists who rap together on each
                            album. As can be expected, Joey Bada$$ is the artist who appears most in
                            the corpus; his node is largest. Of the four projects in the corpus,
                            1999 has the largest variety of artists rapping on it, with 13 including
                            Joey. Pro Era members Chuck Strangers, CJ Fly, Kirk Knight, Dessy Hinds,
                            Dyemond Lewis, Capital Steez, T’nah Apex, Nyck Caution, and Rokamouth
                            are featured prominently, each appearing on multiple tracks. On Joey’s
                            next release, Rejex, there are only two speakers, Joey and Sample. This
                            is likely due to the ‘throwaway’ nature of the project; it consists of
                            tracks that did not make the cut for Joey’s debut project 1999, as well
                            as tracks he made during his formative years before 1999’s release. On
                            Joey’s third project, Summer Knights, there are slightly fewer artists
                            rapping, with 12. Pro Era still makes a large contribution to the album,
                            but it also features some artists who are not in the posse, such as
                            Smoke DZA and Collie Buddz. This reflects Joey’s increasing prominence
                            in the hip hop world, as well as his desire to branch out and work with
                            different artists. Finally, on Joey’s most recent project—and his first
                            for-profit release—B4.DA.$$., there are only 9 artists who rap on the
                            project, and of these only Dyemond Lewis is a member of Pro Era. The
                            progression of featured artists that can be tracked through Joey’s
                            career (excepting Rejex) can be seen to decrease. This decrease in
                            features is indicative of Joey’s increasing abilities as an artist, and
                            his desire to showcase his own abilities more and more.</p>
                        <h3>Artists Referenced (by Album) Throughout the Corpus</h3>
                        <iframe class="img" src="../svg/FinalHipHopReferences.svg"></iframe>
                        <p>This social network graph depicts the hip-hop figures that are referenced
                            throughout the corpus. The outer circle consists of artists who are
                            referenced only on a single project, while those artists referenced on
                            multiple projects exist in the inner circle. Node size and color
                            reflects the frequency of a reference; for instance, Jay-Z is referenced
                            on all four projects and the corresponding node is large and orange as a
                            result. Artists found in the outer circle seem to be those who Joey
                            likes and respects, as well as those who work with him from time to
                            time. Artists appearing in the inner circle are a bit more interesting.
                            These are artists who have either had a very large role in Joey’s
                            progression as a rapper whether as a friend or as an inspiration. Pro
                            Era is referenced frequently throughout the corpus, as they are Joey’s
                            friends and crew. Jay-Z, Nas, Kanye West, and the Notorious B.I.G. are
                            among artists who played a major role in influencing Joey as a rapper
                            and as an artist. The number of references on each project, with the
                            exception of Rejex, is relatively consistent; each of the other three
                            projects contain about 100 references in total.</p>
                        <h3>Beatmakers in the Corpus</h3>
                        <iframe class="img" src="../svg/production.svg"></iframe>
                        <p>This social network graph reveals the artists behind the production of
                            the tracks on each project; as each project contains approximately the
                            same number of tracks, and only a couple producers are responsible for
                            producing beats on multiple tracks on a project, the graph appears to be
                            relatively evenly distributed. Chuck Strangers, MF DOOM, J. Dilla, and
                            Statik Selektah are the most prevalent in the corpus, and their styles
                            of beatmaking are all distinctly in the style of old school, “Golden
                            Age” hip-hop (1990s). The fact that Joey chooses to work with each of
                            these artists on multiple tracks shows his reverence and appreciation
                            for the old school hip hop sounds generated by each of those artists. A
                            revealing fact is that many of the producers’ sounds Joey utilizes on
                            his first three projects, mixtapes he gave away for free, are available
                            for free online (MF DOOM and J.Dilla are two notable examples of
                            producers with prolific catalogs available for free online). However, on
                            his album, Joey turns to more popular and in-vogue producers such as
                            Hit-Boy, Basquiat, and a J.Dilla beat reworked by The Roots. This
                            reveals the growth of Joey’s music to a more selective space; as a more
                            popular and well-known artist by the time he began to make B4.DA.$$.,
                            Joey was able to handpick the producers he wanted to work with on his
                            debut album, rather than working within a catalog of beats available for
                            free online.</p>

                                and the node size indicates overall frequency throughout the corpus.
                                The color is graded from green to red by frequency of appearance,
                                with green being lowest and red being highest.</p>

                        <h3>What is African American Vernacular?</h3>
                        <p>African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is a dialect of American
                            English that was established as a creole language (in layman’s terms a
                            language that is a combination of two different languages) that was
                            formed during slavery and developed through racial segregation in the
                            US. Its root languages are those spoken by African slaves and American
                            English. These two came in contact during the times of slavery, and the
                            language developed into its own dialect through segregation of slaves
                            and later on African American citizens from white citizens. In modern
                            times, AAVE is primarily spoken by working-class American’s who live in
                            urban settings. While the language is spoken by all ethnicities, its
                            primary users are Black American’s living in the previously mentioned
                            socio-economic class.<br /><br /> Like all dialects, there are negative
                            and positive connotations with its use. In Hip-Hop culture, it is often
                            used as a means of developing street cred. Hip-Hop was created by the
                            African American community as a form of musical expression, the roots of
                            which date back to songs sung by slaves in American and the Caribbean.
                            As you can see, there is a historical relationship between the creation
                            of AAVE and the creation of Hip-Hop, which highlights the importance of
                            the use of the dialect in the music. </p><h3>Our Goal:</h3>
                        <p>In looking at AAVE, we hoped to see how its use evolves as Joey develops
                            both as a rapper and as a member of the Hip-Hop community. I had
                            predicted that there would be a growth overtime in the use of AAVE in
                            Joey’s songs. </p>

                        <iframe class="lingGraph" src="../svg/rejexling.svg"></iframe>

                        <h3>What we found:</h3>
                        <p>The graphs above gives us a count of the linguistic information coded in
                            our data. As you can see from the graphs above, for the majority of the
                            categories, the count of their use declines as Joey’s career progresses
                            with the exception of his mixtape Rejex. As we have seen in all of our
                            analysis of the data, Rejex seems to be an outlier in a relatively
                            steady growth/decline. This is most likely due to the fact that Rejex
                            was a collection of rejected material which is described in more detail
                            on the Projects Page.<br /><br /> With the exclusion of Rejex, we do see
                            a gradual decline of the use of AAVE in the albums. This suggests that
                            Joey has decreased his use of these devices as a whole over the course
                            of his career. This could be a result of not feeling the need to develop
                            “street cred” as he is already a well-known member of the rap community.
                            It could also suggest that he has become a more mainstream rapper. As
                            white men make up one of the largest sections of the Hip-Hop audience,
                            there may be a desire to shift the dialect use to be more accessible to
                            that audience as a rapper becomes more mainstream.<br /><br /> The
                            graphs also show an increase of the use of compounds and foreign
                            languages. This is most likely due to Joey becoming a more knowledgeable
                            rapper and developing new linguistic tools as he ages. Unlike the use of
                            AAVE, which are all the devices to the left of compounds, there is
                            nothing that would suggest that this would decline as his audience
                            changes.</p>
                        <div class="alignleft">
                            <p> Because we see the largest use of <a
                                    href="../xhtml/methodology.xhtml#contraction">Contraction</a>
                                and <a href="../xhtml/methodology.xhtml#deletion">Deletion</a>. I
                                wanted to look at what the various aspects of those devices and how
                                they were used. What I first focused on was how <a
                                    href="../xhtml/methodology.xhtml#deletion">Deletion</a> was
                                used. I wanted to see which word class was used with the most
                                frequency and how that relates to AAVE. To the right there is a
                                chart outlining which word class is used with what frequency. </p>
                            <p>As you can see, Copula is the category that is most often deleted.
                                This is due to the lack of copulas in the African languages that
                                AAVE originated in. Copulas are connecting verbs that stem from the
                                verb to be. Despite the fact that copulas often referred to as
                                deleted in AAVE, this word class is not seen in the African
                                languages that AAVE originated from thus they never existed in the
                                dialect. This is why we see this category appear as deleted with
                                such frequency. However, in comparison to Standard American English
                                (SAE) it can be seen as deletion. The second word class we see is
                                auxiliaries. These are "supporting words" like do, would, will, and
                                other words that do not carry on them tense but not much semantic
                                meaning. These words are easily dropped in all dialects of American
                                English as they are easily contracted and then dropped from speech.
                                The remaining categories are more likely deleted do to creativity
                                rather than anything else. </p>
                            <p>For <a href="../xhtml/methodology.xhtml#contraction">Contraction</a>,
                                I looked at which were the most common words to be contracted as
                                shown in the chart to the left. As you can see, there are
                                significantly more possibilities for the words of a contraction and
                                these words have various different part of speech classifications.
                                However, the second word in a contraction is made from a smaller
                                selection of words that are primarily function words that don't
                                contain semantic meaning and are rather used to create the sentence.
                                Finally, the third word, which is rather rare in occurrence, is
                                primarily the word "to" with only two exceptions to that. This is
                                most likely from the frequency of the word "I'mma" which is a
                                contraction of the words "I'm going to."</p>
                            <p>This information tells us a little bit about how contractions
                                function in both AAVE and in SAE. In both cases the words that
                                contains the most meaning is usually the first word, while the
                                second and third words are functional in their nature. This suggests
                                that we are able to combine the meaning of these words for easier
                                function.</p>
                            <p>From each AAVE category that was collected, we can learn more about
                                the function of AAVE particularly in a creative setting. While this
                                is a relatively small corpus to make conclusions on as a whole, it
                                gives us some insight to how AAVE is used in Hip-Hop and in general.

                            pattern is rather similar across the poetic devices, however, the two
                            that stand out the most are seen in the data on rhyme and slant rhyme.
                            While Joey’s work averaged 305 rhyme groups per project in 1999, Summer
                            Knights, and B4.DA.$$, Rejex only contained 172 rhyme groups per
                            project. Similarly, when one examines his use of slant rhyme, the same
                            pattern emerges. In 1999, Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$, the average
                            slant rhyme group per project was 180.67, while in Rejex there were only
                            70 slant rhyme groups. This discussion of the discrepancy is not meant
                            to imply that musically 1999, Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$. are better
                            pieces of work, there are a multitude of factors outside of poetic
                            devices that can determine the quality of a song, beat, sample,
                            production, delivery, theme, etc., rather, it simply shows that Joey’s
                            work on Rejex is not as enhanced by the prevalence of poetry. This
                            notion is further supported when one examines Joey’s own discussion of
                            Rejex, via Datpiff.com, “ “1999 Rejex” is a compilation of tracks that
                            didn't make it to my debut mixtape "1999" (obviously). I decided to put
                            this project together because I have a lot of unreleased material that I
                            didn't want to keep from the ears of my fans and supporters. I also have
                            a couple of tracks on here I did when I was 15 years old ("Little
                            Rachel", "Indubitable", and "Silent Knight") and I want to show people
                            the progress I've made in a couple of years. The remaining songs
                            ("Flowers Pt. I", "Catharsis", "Panty Raid", "Fantum" and "Update") are
                            tracks I dropped prior to the release of '99 as promo only. I look at
                            “Rejex" as my more experimental side compared to '99. Putting together
                            these two projects even taught me a lil sumchin about my evolution as an
                            artist and individual. Watch me go from "Joey B4 DA $$" to the "Joey BA
                            DA $$"...... If you know what eye mean.. Haha -oG $wank”</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, after setting aside Rejex, due to its lack of a clear
                            project theme and the presence of songs that were made years apart, upon
                            examining the poetic statistics of Joey’s three cohesive projects, 1999,
                            Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$ some consistencies were evident as well as
                            differentiation between projects. Firstly, there was minimal discrepancy
                            between the prevalence of alliteration and consonance across the three
                            pieces of work. B4.DA.$$ had significantly less instances of assonance
                            when compared to 1999 and Summer Knights, 25 compared to 68 and 89
                            respectively. Additionally there were large discrepancies between rhyme,
                            B4. (265 groups), Summer Knights (320 groups), and 1999 (330 groups),
                            and slant rhyme, B4. (139 groups), Summer Knights (215 groups) and 1999
                            (188 groups). While one may be tempted to use this data to conclude that
                            B4.DA.$$ is not of the same general quality as 1999 and Summer Knights,
                            similar to the discussion of Rejex in the preceding paragraph, in
                            actuality, the data only demonstrates that Joey’s two mixtapes employ
                            some poetic devices significantly more often than his first studio
                            album. Whatever an individual’s opinion of Joey’s three main musical
                            projects may be, it likely depends on their preference between
                            consistently poetry heavy songs and songs that contains more lyrical,
                            thematic, and poetic variation.</p>
                        <p>When determining Joey’s most poetically creative work, both 1999 and
                            Summer Knights are clearly more poetically innovative than B4.DA.$$.
                            This conclusion is based on an examination of his use of assimilation
                            throughout the three works. In this digital humanities project,
                            assimilation prevalence is used as the benchmark for poetic creativity.
                            This is due to the level of difficulty required to assimilate words, as
                            well as the multitude of factors that are involved in producing a string
                            of assimilation. Additionally, one must possess both a creative and
                            profound understanding of how humans hear and process words in order to
                            produce poetically effective assimilation. Joey’s knack for assimilation
                            allows him to subtly trick the listener’s ear by altering seemingly
                            dissimilar words to produce similar sounds in complex poetic
                            occurrences. This is a skill that only a select group of lyricists
                            possess at a level comparable to Joey, and it is on its greatest display
                            in 1999 and Summer Knights in which there are 57 and 65 different
                            assimilation groups in comparison to B4.DA.$$’s 22. </p></div>
