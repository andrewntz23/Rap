                    <p>The data from our markup on Joey Bada$$’s body of work demonstrates clear
                        patterns in his use of poetic devices. Firstly, other than his use of
                        consonance, which was sparse throughout all four projects, Joey’s
                        implementation of the other poetic devices (<a href="methodology.xhtml#alliteration">alliteration</a>, <a href="methodology.xhtml#assonance">assonance</a>,
                        <a href="methodology.xhtml#assimilation">assimilation</a>, <a href="methodology.xhtml#rhyme">rhyme</a>, and <a href="methodology.xhtml#slantrhyme">slant rhyme</a>) is markedly lower in Rejex when
                        compared to 1999, Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$. This pattern is rather
                        similar across the poetic devices, however, the two that stand out the most
                        are seen in the data on rhyme and slant rhyme. While Joey’s work averaged
                        305 rhyme groups per project in 1999, Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$, Rejex
                        only contained 172 rhyme groups per project. Similarly, when one examines
                        his use of slant rhyme, the same pattern emerges. In 1999, Summer Knights,
                        and B4.DA.$$, the average slant rhyme group per project was 180.67, while
                        in Rejex there were only 70 slant rhyme groups. This discussion of the
                        discrepancy is not meant to imply that musically 1999, Summer Knights, and
                        B4.DA.$$. are better pieces of work, there are a multitude of factors
                        outside of poetic devices that can determine the quality of a song, beat,
                        sample, production, delivery, theme, etc., rather, it simply shows that
                        Joey’s work on Rejex is not as enhanced by the prevalence of poetry. This
                        notion is further supported when one examines Joey’s own discussion of
                        Rejex, via Datpiff.com, “ “1999 Rejex” is a compilation of tracks that
                        didn't make it to my debut mixtape "1999" (obviously). I decided to put this
                        project together because I have a lot of unreleased material that I didn't
                        want to keep from the ears of my fans and supporters. I also have a couple
                        of tracks on here I did when I was 15 years old ("Little Rachel",
                        "Indubitable", and "Silent Knight") and I want to show people the progress
                        I've made in a couple of years. The remaining songs ("Flowers Pt. I",
                        "Catharsis", "Panty Raid", "Fantum" and "Update") are tracks I dropped prior
                        to the release of '99 as promo only. I look at “Rejex" as my more
                        experimental side compared to '99. Putting together these two projects even
                        taught me a lil sumchin about my evolution as an artist and individual.
                        Watch me go from "Joey B4 DA $$" to the "Joey BA DA $$"...... If you know
                        what eye mean.. Haha -oG $wank”</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, after setting aside Rejex, due to its lack of a clear project
                        theme and the presence of songs that were made years apart, upon examining
                        the poetic statistics of Joey’s three cohesive projects, 1999, Summer
                        Knights, and B4.DA.$$ some consistencies were evident as well as
                        differentiation between projects. Firstly, there was minimal discrepancy
                        between the prevalence of alliteration and consonance across the three
                        pieces of work. B4.DA.$$ had significantly less instances of assonance
                        when compared to 1999 and Summer Knights, 25 compared to 68 and 89
                        respectively. Additionally there were large discrepancies between rhyme, B4.
                        (265 groups), Summer Knights (320 groups), and 1999 (330 groups), and slant
                        rhyme, B4. (139 groups), Summer Knights (215 groups) and 1999 (188 groups).
                        While one may be tempted to use this data to conclude that B4.DA.$$ is
                        not of the same general quality as 1999 and Summer Knights, similar to the
                        discussion of Rejex in the preceding paragraph, in actuality, the data only
                        demonstrates that Joey’s two mixtapes employ some poetic devices
                        significantly more often than his first studio album. Whatever an
                        individual’s opinion of Joey’s three main musical projects may be, it likely
                        depends on their preference between consistently poetry heavy songs and
                        songs that contains more lyrical, thematic, and poetic variation.</p>
                    <p>When determining Joey’s most poetically creative work, both 1999 and Summer
                        Knights are clearly more poetically innovative than B4.DA.$$. This
                        conclusion is based on an examination of his use of assimilation throughout
                        the three works. In this digital humanities project, assimilation prevalence
                        is used as the benchmark for poetic creativity. This is due to the level of
                        difficulty required to assimilate words, as well as the multitude of factors
                        that are involved in producing a string of assimilation. Additionally, one
                        must possess both a creative and profound understanding of how humans hear
                        and process words in order to produce poetically effective assimilation.
                        Joey’s knack for assimilation allows him to subtly trick the listener’s ear
                        by altering seemingly dissimilar words to produce similar sounds in complex
                        poetic occurrences. This is a skill that only a select group of lyricists
                        possess at a level comparable to Joey, and it is on its greatest display in
                        1999 and Summer Knights in which there are 57 and 65 different assimilation
                        groups in comparison to B4.DA.$$’s 22. </p>
