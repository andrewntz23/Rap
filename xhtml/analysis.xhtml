                        <p>Motif Graph (Overall) Writeup
                            The bar representing the ‘women’ tag is quite high due to the fact that each instance of “she” and “her” is tagged throughout the corpus, inflating the results (as compared to where they would be if each instance of a woman being referenced was marked rather than every word indicating a woman); additionally, certain songs (“That Gushy,” for instance) contain a count of ‘women’ references that is above average.
                            Violence is a common theme due to the rough area of Brooklyn in which Joey grew up and which played a heavy influence on his hip-hop style.
                            Success, whether pursuit or possession, is a common theme in Joey’s music due to the lofty aspirations that he has for himself and his crew, the Pros.
                            The hiphop and money tags are expectedly higher than average due to the fact that they are important themes in Joey’s life; Joey has said that hip-hop raised him, and money is an obvious focus for him (as can be seen in the title of his first album, B4.DA.$$. —read as “Before da Money”).
                            Religion was a strong part of Joey’s upbringing, and currently holds profound beliefs involving third-eye mysticism, and this is reflected in the number of occurrences of the ‘religion’ tag.
                            Sex is a somewhat obvious topic of discussion for a young, newly successful rap star..

                    <p>We utilized Cytoscape, a tool that is used for generating Social Network Graphs, in order to graphically display our data in an engaging and interesting way. We generated three social network graphs, each of which use the albums as nodes and their relationship with other nodes as edges. Using xslt we gathered the data on (respectively) artists, producers, and hip hop references, and developed the following three graphs tracking the frequency of appearance of these elements.</p>
                    <h3>Artists who Rapped Together on the Same Song in the Corpus</h3>
                    <iframe src="../svg/FinalRappedTogether.svg"/>
                    <p>This social network graph reveals the artists who rap together on each album. As can be expected, Joey Bada$$ is the artist who appears most in the corpus; his node is largest. Of the four projects in the corpus, 1999 has the largest variety of artists rapping on it, with 13 including Joey. Pro Era members Chuck Strangers, CJ Fly, Kirk Knight, Dessy Hinds, Dyemond Lewis, Capital Steez, T’nah Apex, Nyck Caution, and Rokamouth are featured prominently, each appearing on multiple tracks. On Joey’s next release, Rejex, there are only two speakers, Joey and Sample. This is likely due to the ‘throwaway’ nature of the project; it consists of tracks that did not make the cut for Joey’s debut project 1999, as well as tracks he made during his formative years before 1999’s release. On Joey’s third project, Summer Knights, there are slightly fewer artists rapping, with 12. Pro Era still makes a large contribution to the album, but it also features some artists who are not in the posse, such as Smoke DZA and Collie Buddz. This reflects Joey’s increasing prominence in the hip hop world, as well as his desire to branch out and work with different artists. Finally, on Joey’s most recent project—and his first for-profit release—B4.DA.$$., there are only 9 artists who rap on the project, and of these only Dyemond Lewis is a member of Pro Era. The progression of featured artists that can be tracked through Joey’s career (excepting Rejex) can be seen to decrease. This decrease in features is indicative of Joey’s increasing abilities as an artist, and his desire to showcase his own abilities more and more.</p>
                    <h3>Artists Referenced (by Album) Throughout the Corpus</h3>
                    <iframe src="../svg/FinalHipHopReferences.svg"/>
                    <p>This social network graph depicts the hip-hop figures that are referenced throughout the corpus. The outer circle consists of artists who are referenced only on a single project, while those artists referenced on multiple projects exist in the inner circle. Node size and color reflects the frequency of a reference; for instance, Jay-Z is referenced on all four projects and the corresponding node is large and orange as a result. Artists found in the outer circle seem to be those who Joey likes and respects, as well as those who work with him from time to time. Artists appearing in the inner circle are a bit more interesting. These are artists who have either had a very large role in Joey’s progression as a rapper whether as a friend or as an inspiration. Pro Era is referenced frequently throughout the corpus, as they are Joey’s friends and crew. Jay-Z, Nas, Kanye West, and the Notorious B.I.G. are among artists who played a major role in influencing Joey as a rapper and as an artist. The number of references on each project, with the exception of Rejex, is relatively consistent; each of the other three projects contain about 100 references in total.</p>
                    <h3>Beatmakers in the Corpus</h3>
                    <iframe src="../svg/production.svg"/>
                    <p>This social network graph reveals the artists behind the production of the tracks on each project; as each project contains approximately the same number of tracks, and only a couple producers are responsible for producing beats on multiple tracks on a project, the graph appears to be relatively evenly distributed. Chuck Strangers, MF DOOM, J. Dilla, and Statik Selektah are the most prevalent in the corpus, and their styles of beatmaking are all distinctly in the style of old school, “Golden Age” hip-hop (1990s). The fact that Joey chooses to work with each of these artists on multiple tracks shows his reverence and appreciation for the old school hip hop sounds generated by each of those artists. A revealing fact is that many of the producers’ sounds Joey utilizes on his first three projects, mixtapes he gave away for free, are available for free online (MF DOOM and J.Dilla are two notable examples of producers with prolific catalogs available for free online). However, on his album, Joey turns to more popular and in-vogue producers such as Hit-Boy, Basquiat, and a J.Dilla beat reworked by The Roots. This reveals the growth of Joey’s music to a more selective space; as a more popular and well-known artist by the time he began to make B4.DA.$$., Joey was able to handpick the producers he wanted to work with on his debut album, rather than working within a catalog of beats available for free online.</p>

                            overall frequency throughout the corpus. The color is graded from green
                            to red by frequency of appearance, with green being lowest and red being
                            highest.</p>

                    <p>The data from our markup on Joey Bada$$’s body of work demonstrates clear
                        patterns in his use of poetic devices. Firstly, other than his use of
                        consonance, which was sparse throughout all four projects, Joey’s
                        implementation of the other poetic devices (<a href="methodology.xhtml#alliteration">alliteration</a>, <a href="methodology.xhtml#assonance">assonance</a>,
                        <a href="methodology.xhtml#assimilation">assimilation</a>, <a href="methodology.xhtml#rhyme">rhyme</a>, and <a href="methodology.xhtml#slantrhyme">slant rhyme</a>) is markedly lower in Rejex when
                        compared to 1999, Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$. This pattern is rather
                        similar across the poetic devices, however, the two that stand out the most
                        are seen in the data on rhyme and slant rhyme. While Joey’s work averaged
                        305 rhyme groups per project in 1999, Summer Knights, and B4.DA.$$, Rejex
                        only contained 172 rhyme groups per project. Similarly, when one examines
                        his use of slant rhyme, the same pattern emerges. In 1999, Summer Knights,
                        and B4.DA.$$, the average slant rhyme group per project was 180.67, while
                        in Rejex there were only 70 slant rhyme groups. This discussion of the
                        discrepancy is not meant to imply that musically 1999, Summer Knights, and
                        B4.DA.$$. are better pieces of work, there are a multitude of factors
                        outside of poetic devices that can determine the quality of a song, beat,
                        sample, production, delivery, theme, etc., rather, it simply shows that
                        Joey’s work on Rejex is not as enhanced by the prevalence of poetry. This
                        notion is further supported when one examines Joey’s own discussion of
                        Rejex, via Datpiff.com, “ “1999 Rejex” is a compilation of tracks that
                        didn't make it to my debut mixtape "1999" (obviously). I decided to put this
                        project together because I have a lot of unreleased material that I didn't
                        want to keep from the ears of my fans and supporters. I also have a couple
                        of tracks on here I did when I was 15 years old ("Little Rachel",
                        "Indubitable", and "Silent Knight") and I want to show people the progress
                        I've made in a couple of years. The remaining songs ("Flowers Pt. I",
                        "Catharsis", "Panty Raid", "Fantum" and "Update") are tracks I dropped prior
                        to the release of '99 as promo only. I look at “Rejex" as my more
                        experimental side compared to '99. Putting together these two projects even
                        taught me a lil sumchin about my evolution as an artist and individual.
                        Watch me go from "Joey B4 DA $$" to the "Joey BA DA $$"...... If you know
                        what eye mean.. Haha -oG $wank”</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, after setting aside Rejex, due to its lack of a clear project
                        theme and the presence of songs that were made years apart, upon examining
                        the poetic statistics of Joey’s three cohesive projects, 1999, Summer
                        Knights, and B4.DA.$$ some consistencies were evident as well as
                        differentiation between projects. Firstly, there was minimal discrepancy
                        between the prevalence of alliteration and consonance across the three
                        pieces of work. B4.DA.$$ had significantly less instances of assonance
                        when compared to 1999 and Summer Knights, 25 compared to 68 and 89
                        respectively. Additionally there were large discrepancies between rhyme, B4.
                        (265 groups), Summer Knights (320 groups), and 1999 (330 groups), and slant
                        rhyme, B4. (139 groups), Summer Knights (215 groups) and 1999 (188 groups).
                        While one may be tempted to use this data to conclude that B4.DA.$$ is
                        not of the same general quality as 1999 and Summer Knights, similar to the
                        discussion of Rejex in the preceding paragraph, in actuality, the data only
                        demonstrates that Joey’s two mixtapes employ some poetic devices
                        significantly more often than his first studio album. Whatever an
                        individual’s opinion of Joey’s three main musical projects may be, it likely
                        depends on their preference between consistently poetry heavy songs and
                        songs that contains more lyrical, thematic, and poetic variation.</p>
                    <p>When determining Joey’s most poetically creative work, both 1999 and Summer
                        Knights are clearly more poetically innovative than B4.DA.$$. This
                        conclusion is based on an examination of his use of assimilation throughout
                        the three works. In this digital humanities project, assimilation prevalence
                        is used as the benchmark for poetic creativity. This is due to the level of
                        difficulty required to assimilate words, as well as the multitude of factors
                        that are involved in producing a string of assimilation. Additionally, one
                        must possess both a creative and profound understanding of how humans hear
                        and process words in order to produce poetically effective assimilation.
                        Joey’s knack for assimilation allows him to subtly trick the listener’s ear
                        by altering seemingly dissimilar words to produce similar sounds in complex
                        poetic occurrences. This is a skill that only a select group of lyricists
                        possess at a level comparable to Joey, and it is on its greatest display in
                        1999 and Summer Knights in which there are 57 and 65 different assimilation
                        groups in comparison to B4.DA.$$’s 22. </p>
