                    help but notice your views</line><line> So many aspects of truth</line><line> In
                    fact you let the past get to you</line><line> So thoughts on a better future, it
                    couldn't suit you alone</line><line> We was stoned, by the snakes of this life
                    of sin</line><line> But you taught me a life lesson, the fight
                    within</line><line> Use the power of our minds, I was confused at some hour in
                    time</line><line> My eyes were dark brown but blind</line><line> But, now I see
                    even the sun shines through blinds</line><line> And now I move enlighten in

                    You was the big bro I never ever had you know?</line><line> Why you had to go?
                    It hurt me inside</line><line> I feel guilty walking around outside with false

                    one more line or share one more rhyme</line><line> Even show me one more sign of
                    destiny itself would be fine</line><line> But there's no turning back the, hands
                    of time</line><line> Or delayin' the plans of your mastermind</line><line> So I
                    hope you came across of what you had to find</line><line> And watch over the
                    ones you once loved</line><line> You was my nigga when push came to
