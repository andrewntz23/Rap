                    Stacking them chicks up in Saks Fifth</line><line> But word is bond, you been

                    destiny itself would be fine</line><line> But there's no turning back the, hands
                    of time</line><line> Or delayin' the plans of your mastermind</line><line> So I
                    hope you came across of what you had to find</line><line> And watch over the
